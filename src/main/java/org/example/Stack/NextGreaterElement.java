Problem Statement:
                     Given a circular integer array A, return the next greater element for every element in A.
                     The next greater element for an element x is the first element greater than x that we come across while traversing the array in a clockwise manner.
                     If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this element.

Example 1:

Input: N = 11, A[] = {3,10,4,2,1,2,6,1,7,2,9};
Output: 10,-1,6,6,2,6,7,7,9,9,10

Explanation: For the first element in A ,i.e, 3, the greater element which comes next to it while traversing and is closest to it is 10.
Hence,10 is present on index 0 in the resultant array.
Now for the second element,i.e, 10, there is no greater number and hence -1 is itâ€™s next greater element (NGE).
Similarly, we got the NGEs for all other elements present in A.

Example 2:

Input:  N = 6, A[] = {5,7,1,7,6,0}
Output: 7,-1,7,-1,7,5
